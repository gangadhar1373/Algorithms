## Frequency counter
This technique is used when we need to compare multiple pieces of data like arrays or strings and find if they consist of similar values or if they are anagrams means to check frequencies of the values.

This pattern uses objects or sets to collect values/frequencies of values.

This can avoid nested loops. So that it improves performance and reduce time complexity.
