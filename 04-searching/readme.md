## Linear search

Checking one item at a time.
JS has many different search methods on arrays

1. indexOf
2. includes
3. find
4. findIndex

## Binary search

Binary search is much faster.
Rather than eliminating on element at a time you can eliminate half of the elements at a time
Note: Binary search only works with sorted arrays!
